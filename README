This is a sample project directory that can be used with
the tutorial found at https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial

The directory is named "project" which matches the name
used in the example for "Importing a new project".

In addition to this README, there are files named
file1, file2, and file3, as well as a subdirectory
named subdir1 containing a file named subfile.
